Project

A one-page frontend app will be developed that has a sidebar including the brand switching tab and an accordion menu and has the content area including the social media posts. 

Notes:

1) Both PSD & Sketch files of the design are included in the assets folder. You can use whichever you want while developing the frontend app.

2) A data.json file is included in the assets folder as well. The frontend app has to read the data.json file to render the social media posts dynamically.

3) You can choose the frontend tech stack as you want (Pure HTML, Bootstrap, React, Vue.js, etc..)

4) While rendering the posts, replace broken images in the data.json dynamically with the no-post-image.png file that is provided in the assets.

5) The post structure in the data.json file includes a â€˜statusâ€™ field. As a helper, status types by code: 0 for Need Approval, 1 for Scheduled, 2 for Publishing, 3 for Published, 4 for Error

6) Upload the project source code to the GitHub repository of yours and share the public link of the project with us.
